<h2 id="structure-section1">Setting up the Basics</h2>
<p>The first thing you will need to do is refer to a Sitemap.</p>
<p>You will then need to follow this order when setting up the basics:</p>
<ol>
    <li>Set up Groups</li>
    <li>Set up Pages</li>
    <li>Set up Menus</li>
</ol>
<p>Please see below for more information on each of the steps.</p>

<h3 id="page-subsection">1. Adding Groups</h3>
<p>Every page will need a group, so it is important to set these up before you start adding any pages. If you realise you need more groups, these can be added at anytime. By creating the groups first this will allow:
<ul>
    <li>URLs to show the correct path to the page</li>
    <li>Breadcrumbs to work</li>
    <li>Adding menus</li>
</ul>
<p>Without a group, you will not be able to add a menu.</p>

<h3 id="page-subsection1">2. Adding Pages</h3>
<p>Now you have all your groups set up, you will need to set up the pages.</p>
<ul>
    <li>All the pages that are going to be the first one in a group will need a slug of <strong>index</strong>. Otherwise the URL could potentially read i.e. our-team/our-team </li>
    <li>Make sure that you assign the layout of <strong>default</strong> to every page</li>
</ul>

</div>

<h3 id="page-subsection2">3. Adding Groups</h3>
<p>No you have added all your pages, you will need to create menus. You will need to set up the following:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Main navigation (this will be under the group <strong>Index</strong>)</li>
    <li>Set up submenus (if any). Remember once you have set up the menu, you will then need to assign it to an item in the main naviation</li>
    <li>Footer links</li>
</ul>
