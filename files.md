<h2 id="files-section">Adding files</h2>
<p>The file manager allows you to sort and use files on your website.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hover over the <strong>Content</strong> tab at the top.</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Files</strong> from the drop down menu</li> 
</ul>
<p>This will open up in a new window and you then have the option to either <strong>Upload Files</strong> or add a <strong>New Folder.</strong> You can either upload files directly to the root of the file manager or you can create folders to organise your files.</p>

<h3 id="files-subsection">Adding a new folder</h3>
<p>Folders are a good way to organise your files, so you can easily find them again. You can create new folders by clicking the  <strong>New folder</strong> button.</p>

<h3 id="files-subsection1">Uploading files</h3>
<p>Once in the desired folder, click on the <strong>Upload files</strong> button.</p>
<img src="../images/upload-files.png" style="width:125px;" alt="Upload files button">
<p>This will display the upload interface.</p>

<p>You can either drag files onto the window or click <strong>Browse</strong> to upload files. Simply select the files you would like to upload and then click <strong>Open</strong>.</p>
<p>Once the files have run through the upload, they will appear in the folder.</p>
<h3 id="files-subsection2">Switching Views</h3>
<p>There are two ways to browse the files in the file manager. You can choose between a <strong>list</strong> or <strong>icon</strong> view by clicking the <strong>Switch View </strong>icon at the top of the window.</p>
<div class="callout callout--info">
    <img src="../images/switch-view.png" style="width:50px; margin-bottom:10px;" alt="Switch View button">
    <p><strong>List view</strong> This is great for finding a file fast. You can even click on any of the table headers and choose to show the most recent or oldest file.</p>
    <p><strong>Icon view</strong> This allows you to see a thumbanail of image files, and works in the same way you would add a file to a folder on your computer.</p>
</div>
<h3 id="files-subsection3">Searching for files</h3>
<p>Use the search button if you know the name of the file you are looking for. Search results appear in the main window like a folder.</p>
<img src="../images/file-search.png" style="width:200px;" alt="search box">
<h3 id="files-subsection4">Rename and replace</h3>
<p>The file manager also comes with the option of renaming or replacing files.</p>
<div class="callout callout--warning">
    <p>This is an easy way to edit a file without having to worry about it breaking the website. The CMS will automatically apply your changes throughout the whole site.</p>
    <p><strong>Edit</strong></p>
    <p><img class="icons" src="../images/file-edit.png">This will allow you to edit the file name.</p>
    <p><strong>Replace</strong></p>
    <p><img class="icons" src="../images/file-replace.png">This allows you to update a file. The benefit of replacing over adding a new file is you will not need to amend the file path if the document is being used somewhere on the website.</p>
