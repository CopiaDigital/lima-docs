<h2 id="news-section">Adding a news article</h2>
<p>Before you can add a news article, you need to set up the categories.</p>

<h3 id="news-subsection">Adding a category</h3>
<p>Categories are used to easily manage the news articles and enable you to filter out your content on the website.</p>
<ul>
    <li>Hover over the <strong>News</strong> tab at the top.</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Categories</strong> from the drop down menu.</li> 
    <li>On the right-hand-side of the page there is a button called <strong>Add a new group</strong>, click this.</li>
</ul>
<img src="../images/new-group.png" style="width:200px" alt="Add a new group button">

<p>You will then need to enter details to add the group. The fields are:</p>
<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Name</strong> This is the name of the group.</p>
    <p><strong>Slug</strong>This will generate automatically from the name and will appear in the URL to show you the path of the page.</p>
    <p><strong>Parent</strong>You have the option to nest your groups within other groups.</p>
    <p><strong>Hide from public lists</strong>You can choose whether to make your group public or not.</p>
</div>
<p>Now the category has been created you can create a new article</p>

<h3 id="news-subsection1">Adding a new article</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Hover over the <strong>News</strong> tab at the top.</li>
    <li>Select <strong>Articles</strong> from the drop down menu.</li> 
    <li>On the right-hand-side of the page there is a button called <strong>Add a new article</strong>, click this.</li>
</ul>
<img src="../images/new-article.png" style="width:200px" alt="Add a new article button">

<p>You will then need to enter details to add the article. The fields are:</p>
<div class="callout callout--info">
    <p><strong>Subject</strong> This is the name of the article.</p>
    <p><strong>Slug</strong>This will generate automatically from the name and will appear in the URL to show you the path of the article.</p>
    <p><strong>Published</strong>From this dropdown you can select the following options:</p>
    <p><i>Yes</i> - This will show the article as live.</p>
    <p><i>Scheduled</i> - This allows you to schedule when you want the page to go live.</p>
    <p><i>No</i> - This will stay as a draft, until you change the status.</p>
    <p><strong>Publish date</strong>You can choose the date you would like the article to show and even backdate articles.</p>
    <p><strong>Categories</strong>If you have set up one category, it will pre-select this by default. If you create more than one, you will then be able to select as many categories that are relevant to the article.</p>
    <p><strong>Introduction to article</strong>You can add a couple of lines to introduce the article - this will show on the news list page (you add content to this the same way as you would a page).</p>
    <p><strong>Body of article</strong>This is where you put the entire article content. This is the content that will show on the individual news item (you add content to this the same way as you would a page).</p>
